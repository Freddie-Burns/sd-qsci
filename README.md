# Single Determinant QSCI

**Investigating the effectiveness of single Slater determinant trial wavefunctions for QSCI methods.**

This project explores how well simple mean-field states—such as unrestricted or restricted Hartree–Fock (UHF/RHF) single determinants—serve as **trial wavefunctions** in **quantum simulation chemistry (QSCI)** workflows.
The goal is to benchmark their performance and limitations when used in hybrid classical–quantum methods and related post-HF quantum algorithms.

---

## Motivation

Many quantum chemistry and quantum simulation algorithms rely on a trial wavefunction to initialize or constrain a variational search.
While multi-determinant or correlated references can improve accuracy, **single Slater determinants** (from UHF or RHF) remain the simplest and most computationally efficient choice.

This repository aims to:

* Quantify the accuracy of single-determinant trials across small molecules.
* Compare UHF vs RHF determinants as initial states.
* Interface **PySCF** (for reference and integral generation) with **Qiskit** (for quantum simulation).

## Installation

This project uses [**uv**](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Freddie-Burns/sd-qsci.git
cd sd-qsci

# Install all dependencies (creates virtual environment automatically)
uv sync

# Install with dev dependencies (includes Sphinx, JupyterLab, etc.)
uv sync --all-groups
```

### Main dependencies

* [PySCF](https://pyscf.org) — ab initio electronic structure calculations

## Quick start

Launch Jupyter notebooks to explore examples:

```bash
uv run jupyter lab
```

Example topics you can explore:

- Building second-quantized Hamiltonians from PySCF systems
- Constructing RHF→UHF orbital rotation circuits and validating energies
- Running small scans and plotting energies for H4/H6 systems

## Testing

Run tests via:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

---

## Documentation

API documentation is built with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) and hosted at:  
**https://freddie-burns.github.io/sd-qsci/**

### Building docs locally

```bash
# Install dev dependencies (if not already done)
uv sync --all-groups

# Build HTML documentation
uv run python -m sphinx -b html docs/source docs/_build/html

# View the built docs
# On Linux/WSL:
xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html
# On macOS:
open docs/_build/html/index.html
# On Windows:
start docs/_build/html/index.html
```

The documentation includes:
- Full API reference with auto-generated function signatures
- Module documentation for `hamiltonian`, `circuit`, `spin`, `utils`, and `energy`
- Type hints and NumPy-style docstrings

## Research

Hands-on, reproducible experiments live under research/. Start by reading research/README.md, then open a group's README for details and usage, for example:

- research/01_h4_chain — H4 chain energies (RHF/UHF/FCI/QSCI)
- research/02_h6_lattice — H6 triangular lattice energies and QSCI subspace sizing
- research/04_aws_start — AWS Braket device discovery and a small GHZ-state trial

Figures produced by studies are stored in research/figures/.

## Possible extensions

* Benchmark larger systems (LiH, BeH₂, H₂O).
* Compare RHF vs UHF vs multi-determinant expansions.
* Compare with Qiskit Nature Hamiltonian generation.
* Add visualization of orbital correlation and overlap metrics.
