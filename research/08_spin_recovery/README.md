Spin symmetry recovery (08)

Purpose
- Investigate spin-symmetry recovery techniques and their impact on QSCI results.

Scripts
- 08_spin_recovery.py — end-to-end analysis for a small system (configurable bond length and atom count)

Outputs
- Saved under data/08/ ... with per-run subfolders (e.g., bond_length_2.00_spin_symm)

Usage
- From repository root:
  - python research/08_spin_recovery/08_spin_recovery.py
