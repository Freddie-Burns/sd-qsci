02_h6_lattice — H6 triangular lattice

Purpose
- Compare RHF, UHF, FCI, and QSCI energies on an H6 triangular lattice across bond lengths.
- Track QSCI subspace dimension as a function of geometry.

Main script
- 02_h6_lattice.py — scans bond lengths, computes energies, and records QSCI subspace size.

Outputs
- Figure: figures/h6_lattice_energies.png
- Console logs of energies and QSCI subspace size per bond length.

Usage
- From repository root:
  - python research/02_h6_lattice/02_h6_lattice.py
