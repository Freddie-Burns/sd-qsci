Research overview

This directory contains numbered research studies. Each group folder collects related scripts and their data outputs. See each group's README for details and usage.

- 02_h6_lattice — H6 triangular lattice energies and QSCI subspace sizing. See 02_h6_lattice/README.md
- 03_h6_lattice_dev — H6 lattice/chain experiments (config counts, weighting, chain). See 03_h6_lattice_dev/README.md

Conventions
- Data are saved per script under data/<short_code>/..., where <short_code> is the script prefix (e.g., 05a, 06, 09b).
 - Figures generated by studies are stored under figures/ (see figures/README.md).
